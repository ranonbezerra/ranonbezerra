- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ranonbezerra, a brazilian mechanical engineer and crime scene investigator who loves programming (and some gaming) in my free time!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Python, on learning new tools, find inovative ways to think with it and contributing in any place I can. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Web Development with Flask and using Python for Finance Analysis, specifically with stock exchange data analysis.
- :rocket: I've already worked with Python using Pandas, Scikit Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Tkinter, Streamlit, Figma and many other packages.
